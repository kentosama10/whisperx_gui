1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:19,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think mababig.

2
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Baka siguro yung matutuwangan ng video, dahil hindi na ako lang ng mga kanina yung more than, at least 50% of their personnel allowed na work for work.

3
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yal natin diba, yun ako din sila, ipinalize sila ng mga pesa ng mga ano, na ako, dapat mula, more than 10% or something.

4
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:25,988
[SPEAKER_05]: At least paro na rin sa ano, sa mga pesa.

5
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:47,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaya baka kanong na yung work from home?

6
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:49,006
Alam pa kaya, maximum 3 days a week dapat na sa office or spot.

7
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:49,887
So 2 days yung pwede silang work from home.

8
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:50,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero kung kailangan na ma-sa office o na spot.

00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,889

[SPEAKER_09]: Ano nga bang change?

44
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,152
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as yung...

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, si Chad.

00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:27,442
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the manager and si Janan yung senior associate.

47
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:33,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Si Jan, si Ferdy will be... Ay, alig ka anong Mike.

48
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:37,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Si Mike is a partner from Ertax.

49
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:38,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Afternoon.

50
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And Cheds and si Eileen.

51
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:44,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, Angelo is my senior partner.

52
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Si Angelo pala.

53
00:02:46,013 --> 00:03:00,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Sige, mamaya na.

00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:09,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige.

57
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:09,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Tumayo.

58
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,470
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think ito naman for the roles and responsibilities.

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,051
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been observing this.

60
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:12,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala namang change, no?

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:25,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as far as your accounting framework, you will still fall under SMT.

62
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige, next slide.

63
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:37,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the deliverables, same with last year, our primary deliverable will be the audit report.

64
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:40,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in relation to the requirements of BAR and SEC,

65
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:57,363
[SPEAKER_09]: In relation to the audited financial statement, so we also cover them.

66
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:00,507
[SPEAKER_09]: First, yung requirement TBIR na with regards to the taxes paid, so we cover that with our audit report.

67
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on the supplementary schedules required by the SEC, we also cover that.

68
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:23,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the course of our audit, if we note items that will be for improvement of your processes and controls, so we also discussed that will be.

69
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:25,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for the terms of our audit, engagement, that will be summarized in the general engagement.

70
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:33,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a distract.

[SPEAKER_09]: We're closer to the 2019 levels.

119
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:09,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So, nandob pa lang kami as far as the volume is concerned.

120
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:09,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, anong impact sa inyo?

[SPEAKER_09]: Sige lang kami, lo ka lang talaga.

162
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige.

163
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala naman mga one-off na contracts?

164
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Like sa offices mo and in major, capex?

165
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:33,223
Wala.

166
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:33,463
Wala naman.

167
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:55,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Ang mga recurring naman eh, hindi mga, hindi tawil naman mga firewall, mga firewall, mga site, tapos licenses, so... Ano na nga ba ang ano nyo sa IT?

168
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:56,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yung accounting records nyo, ano yung register?

169
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:56,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Nakat-cast na ba?

170
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:56,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala, nandito.

171
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's loose-leaf pa lang.

172
00:09:59,016 --> 00:09:59,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Mabilis na ngayon oh.

173
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:00,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Sabi?

174
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:00,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Dati hindi...

175
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Oo, mabilis na sila ngayon.

176
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindi katulad na... Average 6 months na.

177
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:11,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Now yun, there's one special team ng D.I.R.

178
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:12,543
[SPEAKER_05]: o kad R.D.O.?

179
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:18,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally sa national kasi to doon sa national team.

180
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos meron silang dedicated team doon.

181
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:24,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Although some naman, nat-train na rin nila siguro kaya rin naging mas mabilis.

182
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:30,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos nawala na rin kasi yung, before kasi before ka-issue nang permit, kailangan ng testing.

183
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:33,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Ngayon, yung testing will be done post-audit.

184
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:52,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So issue muna nila yung what they call acknowledgement certificate tapos nakalagay lang doon may nakalagay na statement na you will be subjected to post audit.

185
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:56,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the time of post audit, di ka pala compliant doon sa requirements, yun nga lang may deficiency, may penalties and na pwedeng iimpose.

186
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:57,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Saan namin makikita sa website ba nila ang...

187
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:00,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share that.

188
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:01,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share.

189
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:06,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll share through the link.

190
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:13,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yan kasi the last year sabi niya ang hirap-hirap eh.

191
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Sabi mo, diba?

192
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Years na or something.

193
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:16,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Wala pa mag-prove.

194
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:17,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Ngayon kasi with the OPT.

195
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:28,638
[SPEAKER_01]: yung Isopin Taxes Act really this year tapos continuous kasi sila na they're saying they would like to digitalize.

196
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:30,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Nakita rin naman namin in terms of the process.

197
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:36,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Average of 6 months provided na mabigay naman yung mga documents na required for the application.

198
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:41,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Meron ba kayong client, yung mga tag-apply na naman?

199
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:42,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Marami ba yung male deficiency?

200
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindi naman.

201
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:44,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix actually.

202
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Meron yung talaga kasing detaliado.

203
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:53,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Tinig na nila maiging muna yung document sila before actually filing.

204
00:11:53,975 --> 00:12:00,192
[SPEAKER_01]: To sum it, yung iba nai-involve kami kung baka parang nireview muna namin, then before the actual application.

205
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:03,392
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time of the application, ano na?

206
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:09,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang halos cleared na lahat kasi we do parang informal checking with them.

207
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:14,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung mayroon mga peculiarity dun sa client, sa industry ng client, chini-check namin in advance.

208
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Para once na nagsubmit kami sa kanila, ano na?

209
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,794
[SPEAKER_01]: At least parang na pre-clear na kumbaga.

210
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:23,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos more on formality na lang yung pag-assion acknowledgement certificate.

211
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:29,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang pinabantayan lang namin kasi nakita namin sa mga BIR audit, nagkakaroon ng mismatch.

212
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Ito yung in-apply.

213
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:33,788
[SPEAKER_01]: si isampong dokumentong nakalagay doon na i-generate ng system.

214
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:39,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Paglabas ng acknowledgement certificate o yung permit itself, walong na lang yung nakalagay.

215
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:43,400
[SPEAKER_01]: E, syempre ikaw, all this time you know na in-apply mo yan eh.

216
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So supposedly the permit should show the complete set.

217
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:50,270
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, hindi nagmamatch, hindi na-check.

218
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,171
[SPEAKER_01]: E, na-post audit.

219
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Nagkaroon tulay ng penalties.

220
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:58,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And the penalties kasi, at least yung nakita namin, 1,000 per document.

221
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:04,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh kung meron kaming na-experience, andami, libo rin yung document na na-issue.

222
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,572
[SPEAKER_01]: E di umabag din ang million yung penalty.

223
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:18,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So yun yung nire-remind namin sa audit clients namin and other clients na kung sa kaling may application, although mabilis yung proseso, make sure nabanga yung application dun sa acknowledgement certificate.

224
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:23,675
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the details dapat nandoon sa document.

225
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:24,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Pero yung acknowledgement certificate is issued way after

226
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:28,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the span of 6 months.

227
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:30,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Meron mas mabilis.

228
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Meron mas mabilis.

229
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:36,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Merong it takes time lalo na kung merong deficiencies sa documents.

230
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Nagbabak-import kasi.

231
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:47,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Sabi nila ang medyo nakita namin in our experience na medyo nagkaroon ng difficulty yung ibang kliente.

232
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:53,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung mga IT related documents yung may mga specification talaga as to the technicalities of the system.

233
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Kasi they would like to ensure na yung

234
00:13:54,854 --> 00:14:08,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Nige-generate ng system will be compliant, at least on a high level compliant doon sa requirement signal.

235
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And mayroon na rin pag mag-apply na travel agencies?

236
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:10,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Travel agency?

237
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:16,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang wala pa akong nananood na travel agency.

238
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:17,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Service...

239
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:30,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Service-oriented taxpayers, medyo marami na.

240
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:34,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But specifically to travel agencies, wala.

241
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:41,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi nga walang gusto mag-file dahil nga, pinapakreate nila ako ng tax position paper na dudalan ko kay ano.

242
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi nga, walang, hindi baka ka-comply yung cast namin kung hindi paklear nung taxation, nung ibang issue eh.

243
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:44,183
[SPEAKER_07]: May mga issues kami eh.

244
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:58,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang siguro critical to note lang is yung lalo nalikong yung mga large taxpayers kasi na tax, ah yun ya, in terms of classification kasi sila required.

245
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:09,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang required kasi as of now, strictly speaking, under the law, those that are under the large taxpayers office, those na engage sa exports, sale of goods and services, and those that are engaged in e-commerce.

246
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:14,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So yun yung tatlo right now but we're hearing na if you have

247
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:19,166
[SPEAKER_01]: transactions with large taxpayers, eventually you will be required.

248
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:28,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So sa atin, ako, for sure Philippine Airlines is one of the large taxpayers.

249
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're dealing with airlines.

250
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:29,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So ano yan?

251
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:31,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even Cebu Pacific is a large taxpayer.

252
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:40,188
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that direction will happen soon, makokcover tayo.

253
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:44,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to look out for siguro down there.

254
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:44,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Cross-reference talaga sila.

255
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung i-invoicing kasi yung ano tayo natin.

256
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:49,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Gusto nila.

257
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:55,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And pinupush din kasi sila, even sa mga conventions, conferences outside the Philippines.

258
00:15:55,334 --> 00:16:12,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Yung parang we are saying talaga na we're moving towards digitalization.

259
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:13,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's part of it.

260
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige.

261
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So for regulatory, compliance and regulations, may ano pa ang bumi?

262
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:20,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Examination.

263
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:25,277
[SPEAKER_09]: For 2021?

264
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:26,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Oo, mayroon.

265
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,547
[SPEAKER_09]: For 2023.

266
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:37,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Bilis, sarapan.

267
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:38,018
Later.

268
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,218
Siyempre.

269
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:38,599
Kailangan nila eh.

270
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:38,819
Nang fans.

271
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:39,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Pero nasa ano pala naman?

272
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Examination?

273
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:39,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Oo.

274
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:39,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Wala pa?

275
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:40,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Oo, wala pa.

276
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:40,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

277
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:40,502
Legal cases.

278
00:16:41,275 --> 00:17:06,456
[SPEAKER_05]: May sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa... sa

279
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:33,882
[SPEAKER_05]: na based sa compromise na lang kasi hindi naman talaga na-examine na arbitrary na lang na.

280
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:34,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Naka-buro pa sa no, sa CIR.

281
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:34,722
Ilang ano na?

282
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:35,383
[SPEAKER_09]: When was the last communication?

283
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:35,703
[SPEAKER_09]: 2022 man natin?

284
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:35,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year.

285
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:36,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year may ano.

286
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:36,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige, so...

287
00:17:36,845 --> 00:18:01,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just showed here yung late test niyo na available.

288
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,113
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of ano naman, it looks mas mataasa nga, in terms of P&L, mas mataas yung siguro yung cost lang, there might be some cost, operating cost that needs to be reclassified to their cost.

289
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:28,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Kapital wala namang change.

290
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Still the same yung ano.

291
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:32,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a few items lang that we want to discuss with you as early as now.

292
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Ito yung CWT kasi lumalaki ito eh.

293
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:54,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how much will be added this year, but based on the three-year trend, malaki talaga yung nadadagdag sa kanya.

294
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:57,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's critical is, of course the classification, is to estimate how much is

295
00:18:57,338 --> 00:19:25,658
[SPEAKER_09]: estimated to be applied against the tax due for the year and then reclassify the rest to a non-inferent portion and yun nga talaga what is the plan kasi for financial reporting kasi if you will not tumataas siya and if we go back lang sa balance sheet so nandiyan siya part of the

296
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:38,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I think may portion na nasa non-current.

297
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:38,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

298
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:39,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's 30-something million of the 200.

299
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,855
[SPEAKER_09]: So lumalaki siya eh.

300
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:53,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Pag hindi kasi siya nagagamit in the foreseeable future, there might be a need to make provision kung wala kayong planong

301
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:06,439
[SPEAKER_09]: ...di-apply for refund, which is alam naman natin, no?

302
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:17,035
[SPEAKER_09]: So siguro the only way to realize that is to really make... ...income.

303
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,497
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, ma-address yung... I think kaya siya malaki, diba?

304
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi may nag-withhold sa inyo.

305
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Na dapat hindi, diba?

306
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's credit card, diba?

307
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of credit card payments, yung reimburseable.

308
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:44,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi nga ang withholding then is one half of one percent of the entire amount.

309
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:45,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Dapat service fee lang din namin, kung saan nag-we withhold.

310
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,391
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, that's the rule for credit cards talaga eh, is one half of one percent eh.

311
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:48,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Buti niya lang mababay rate baka eh kung hindi ba mababay.

312
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:49,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaya lang nga eh, nahihit talaga sila cash flow wise.

313
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:50,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Na natatrap eh.

314
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Natatrap 36 na.

315
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:52,277
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know baka

316
00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:03,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka this year, ano?

317
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:04,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka 40 na yan.

318
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Yan yung problema, no?

319
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:09,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi that should have been cash.

320
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:10,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Ang tanong, ano yung timing ng collection?

321
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Kung sa ano pa yan?

322
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:16,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka kung receivable yan, baka doubtful na.

323
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:22,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka may portion dyan na doubtful, not because hindi siya

324
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:26,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Hindi siya, how do you call that?

325
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:33,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Ano naman siya na may support ka ba?

326
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:38,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Kung receivable, collectible ba yan?

327
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:38,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Magagamit ba natin yan?

328
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:38,676
[SPEAKER_09]: When?

329
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:48,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi yung realizability minsan, you have to take into account the time value of money.

330
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:48,792
Parang ganoon eh.

331
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:49,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's something that we may want to check.

332
00:21:50,408 --> 00:22:03,022
[SPEAKER_01]: especially na lumalaki na talaga siya.

333
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:08,088
[SPEAKER_01]: So, BIR naman, provided na it's properly supported, wala naman issue.

334
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:13,534
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for accounting purposes, there's a need to check ngayon for realizability.

335
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:17,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But for BIR naman, provided na it's properly supported and recognized in the ITR, wala naman concern sa site natin.

336
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano lang?

337
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Sa financial reporting lang eh.

338
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:41,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for tax talaga, if you don't see na maggamit niyo siya, magano ko talaga, you will have to buy the book.

339
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Depende, no?

340
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Kung kaya niyo mag-apply for refund.

341
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,082
[SPEAKER_09]: But for financial reporting, ano talaga niya?

342
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:57,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka dapat iyan na siya.

343
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:00,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Magpaprovide ka ng allowance.

344
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi nga, you don't see na magagamit mo siya in the next so many years.

345
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,062
[SPEAKER_09]: But if something ano na magagamit ko siya, you can always reverse naman ng allowance.

346
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero kung ang tax, nandyan lang yan.

347
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:09,149
[SPEAKER_09]: It's yours, no?

348
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:13,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Yun lang.

349
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Iba kasi ang financial reporting and tax reporting.

350
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:14,297
Sige.

351
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero hopefully, may magagawa doon sa dapat ang withholdan lang.

352
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:36,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Or kahit withholdan kayo, dapat na kahiwalay sa credit card.

353
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi nga, yung income nyo talaga, it's just a small portion of the total.

354
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:55,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige, nice.

355
00:23:55,993 --> 00:24:03,883
[SPEAKER_09]: So ito naman, of course, the adequacy of the allowance for the full account.

356
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:04,624
[SPEAKER_09]: So every year naman, you do this.

357
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Pitingnan lang yung aging and then assess the connectivity.

358
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:09,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige.

359
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,271
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just indicated there.

360
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually dito, we requested sana na interim.

361
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:23,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this something visible sa inyo?

362
00:24:23,502 --> 00:24:32,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Sa... We will look at this sana at in the ring like based on the October 31.

363
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:32,858
[SPEAKER_09]: If ano na yung October 31.

364
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:33,880
[SPEAKER_09]: So malamang...

365
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:46,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Your end na lang.

366
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:50,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Your end na lang.

367
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:59,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Malit lang ba ang receivable?

368
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, kasi nga walang receivable, halos nila ang credit card.

369
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:01,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Walang masyado eh.

370
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:01,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So yun lang yung manualy billed lang.

371
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:02,466
Yung rule checks ng mga clients.

372
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:31,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So ito naman, ito din yung for the certain long outstanding liabilities siguro part of the exercise din lang when you close the books is to check if these are still valid liabilities.

373
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:56,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Minanood lang kami in prior years na... But of course, I think some of these are legitimate, ano naman, you know, deposits kasi they are still your customers.

374
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,331
[SPEAKER_05]: May naiimog ba dyan mula pandemic?

375
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi yung di ba credit lang naman?

376
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Meron pa, yung mga... Yung mga ibang nag-detain ng inside.

377
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung kasi nandang cancer, yung pandemic, yung galang yun.

378
00:26:01,981 --> 00:26:26,825
[SPEAKER_09]: We just have to wait for the parang end period yung mga viability ng mga... Okay, I think... yun lang naman, no?

379
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:27,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless... Do you have any, ano?

380
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,306
[SPEAKER_05]: You feel na baka... kailangan natin, ano?

381
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:28,566
[SPEAKER_05]: The address?

382
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:28,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Wala naman.

383
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:29,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for yung...

384
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:50,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaya hinintay ko sila yung press natin.

385
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:51,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Ang dami kasi, ano?

386
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:55,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige, so anyway, so these are the required inquiries na for management that we just need to inquire from you.

387
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:58,161
[SPEAKER_09]: So first would be on fraud, meron bang anything that was reported during the year or anything that we also need to address during our audit.

388
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:14,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Compliance with laws and regulations?

389
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:17,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I think DIR lang naman yung ano?

390
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Related parties?

391
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:19,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala naman.

392
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:20,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Going concerns?

393
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:20,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala naman tayo.

394
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala naman tayong plans.

395
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:21,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige.

396
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:25,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Independence?

397
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:26,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I think of it by just cyber.

398
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:26,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything na may mga attempts to ano?

399
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:28,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Yung mga, marami lang mga emails.

400
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:28,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Ano yung mga phishing?

401
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:29,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Oo yung mga ganoon.

402
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:29,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero nothing.

403
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,288
[SPEAKER_09]: G-cash?

404
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:31,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala ba sa inyong na ano?

405
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:33,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Wala.

00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:34,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Wala.

407
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:39,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Pero we accept G-cash payments.

408
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:39,597

00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,279

[SPEAKER_09]: Meron

457
00:27:54,149 --> 00:28:10,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Kung sa business niya yun, or personal.

458
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:14,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka naman kasi binigay niya yung mga security password niya kung kadi-ganun mo.

459
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:14,919
Sige, climate-related.

460
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:16,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I think wala naman si Enyo no, kasi be an agent wala naman.

461
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:17,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really more of dun sa mga airlines.

462
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:18,064
[SPEAKER_09]: At least the topic of ano.

463
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:45,655
[SPEAKER_07]: climate change and sustainability na iba lang yung mga seasons nung iba kasi mas mahaban na yung winter or mahaban na yung mga ganyan o yung summer mas mahaban, depende sa lanina, elmino yung mga ganoon yun pala so yun ang ano yun ang effect noon tsaka yung storms, typhoons, cancellation of flights pero may BCP naman na yung case so wala kaming issue

00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:12,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Sa loob?

529
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Dibre na lahat.

530
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:20,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Yun ano, yung direct flight diba, ng Sibupak to Sapporo, diba?

531
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:21,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Nakakaroan na sila.

532
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:21,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Ang pala ba walang?

533
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:25,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Next year pa na.

534
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:25,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, next year din.

535
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:29,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Client mo siya, no?

536
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Client mo siya ng SGC.

537
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:35,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Napapansin?

538
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:36,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Napapansin ko e. Su-su-su na mention.

539
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Sige, kasi ang dami ko gusto ng correct sa nila.

540
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:45,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige.

541
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige, so eto naman, just to share, no?

542
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:48,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are

543
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Also slowly digitizing our audit.

544
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, depende rin yun sa data na makukuha namin.

545
00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:02,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we have used... ano na no?

546
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:03,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

547
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Sige, try.

548
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:19,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Ikaw ang mag-explain yan.

549
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:20,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Eto ang mga bata ang mag-explain yan.

550
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:21,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yung sa Canvas and Client Portal lang po, we're going to continuously use lang pinpo to.

551
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So kindly expect na yung mga audit request put namin will be communicated still through the Canvas Client Portal and then for the automation process po.

552
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:32,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Yung isa po at talaga na hina-highlight naman dito is yung sa IWA intelligence checklist.

553
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So as early as interim, maybe we should revisit na po yung notes disclosure natin.

554
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:53,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yung e-way intelligence checklist ko would assist you on identifying what are the reward disclosures po dun sa LSP.

555
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:55,805
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there are any na wala pa po doon based din sa pagsabot po natin sa scoping ng e-way intelligence checklist ko, maybe we can add po.

556
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:56,326
[SPEAKER_09]: We could consider din po.

557
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:57,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Knowing na medyo strict na din po kasi mga regulations.

558
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:59,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to add, kasi si LSEC wala na siyang

559
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:16,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Wala na siyang oversight sa external auditor because of the Supreme Court ruling that was passed last year.

560
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,691
[SPEAKER_09]: So ang ginawan niya, this year, sinulatan niya selected companies and then nag-review sila ng financial statements and then may mga comments siya.

561
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:23,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So hindi lang listed ha.

562
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:23,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Parang iba-iba.

563
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:24,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So wala naman tayong nar-receive.

564
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yun lang.

565
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:30,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's prepare for that.

566
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:34,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi, medyo, ano sila, madetalia din silang mag-review.

567
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,171
[SPEAKER_09]: At ang cash flow.

568
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:46,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Gusto nila lahat nakikita.

569
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:50,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Parang, hindi naman dapat nilalagay lahat sa notes, sa lahat ng movement.

570
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero gusto nila, pinapa-explain lang nila.

571
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So yun, sa inyo yan isusulag.

572
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:52,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Dati kasi sa amin, direct show yun.

573
00:33:52,808 --> 00:33:53,809
[SPEAKER_09]: So ngayon, sa company sila,

574
00:33:53,941 --> 00:34:01,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Susula.

575
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, we'll coordinate naman.

576
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So yun lang.

577
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:03,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Ang purpose nila.

578
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Parang dapat na yung committee o... Dapat ng compliance.

579
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:07,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Pagkala kung bakit sinaral na sila yun.

580
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:11,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi wala na silang, sabi nila, hindi naman pwede wala kaming gagawin.

581
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:18,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So sige, sa companies tayo magsumula.

582
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:18,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Yun!

583
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:22,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi kami, board of accountancy na yung kanpo.

584
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:44,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the analyzing part, so we will be utilizing the GL Analyzer.

585
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:48,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So more of, yung magiging basis naman po dito is yung data po mismo na ibibigay po ninyo, titignan lang po muna namin kung kaya ba namin siyang ilog dun sa analyzer po namin.

586
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Para medyo, kati na lang din po yung mga itatalong namin sa inyo.

587
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when it comes to moments of the accounts, you will be able to better analyze your data using this tool.

588
00:34:52,328 --> 00:35:12,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the next days po, we are targeting also to continuously adding mga iwan yung tos.

589
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka kung meron ba dito na pwede nating indigitalize na to ensure na hindi na gano'n kadami or ano po yung naralagas po naman sa iso.

590
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:16,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it sa analyzer na yan?

591
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:17,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Ibig sabihin may AI na kayo or it's a static tool?

592
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:19,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, well, meron na kami pero hindi pa.

593
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:20,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Hindi pa siya nakaintegrate.

594
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:21,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Kami pa rin yung bibigyan lang kami ng reports and then we will analyze.

595
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:40,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero meron na.

596
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:41,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Pero hindi pa siya na ano dyan.

597
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:42,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Meron na kaming sarili namin, Chart GPT.

598
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:46,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So pag nalano kami, pag nag-research, mas dapat doon kami mag-research kasi mas reliable nung mga links.

599
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Yung saan kasi Chart GPT kung saan-saan.

600
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:47,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Kung saan-saan kumukuha.

601
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:47,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Siyempre.

602
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:48,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Yung lang available sa kanilang.

603
00:35:48,607 --> 00:36:04,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Sige.

604
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,599
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have the data, siguro, tapos kanunod namin to sa JL Analyzing Board, we can show you some of the reports naman, especially if we have questions.

605
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:09,861
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll further coordinate na lang, further coordinate.

606
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Sino ba ang point person sa ano nga yung ginagamit niyo na tropical?

607
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:19,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Ako po at sya ako si Loida.

608
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:26,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Kami pa rin, ma'am.

609
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:48,886
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're currently presenting also yung proposal of the time period.

610
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,127
[SPEAKER_03]: No significant changes naman pa hades from the prior year po.

611
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:53,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not yet lang po na at least lang sana for this year, we're going to be able to finish yung update on the understanding of the key processes po, natin sa FSM.

612
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:55,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And then early January also, we will be requesting also yung travel plans po and German entries from the prior year.

613
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:56,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Kayo ba yan?

614
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:56,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Kayo po ba yun?

[SPEAKER_09]: For anong purpose?

745
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:44,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

746
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung pag-extract ng data?

747
00:44:49,868 --> 00:44:50,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, iba kasi yung IT namin.

748
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:50,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, po.

749
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:52,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi siya IT.

750
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yung sa GL.

751
00:44:53,373 --> 00:44:55,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yung sa GL.

752
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:56,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Pero kung kaya niyo.

753
00:44:57,314 --> 00:45:04,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Sila yun.

754
00:45:04,842 --> 00:45:25,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi pag successful kasi tayo na makuha namin yung data at hindi na kami hihingi ng marami schedule kasi from that data kaya na niyang... kasi yung program kung saan namin siya ilagay, EY ano naman yun, kaya niyang mag-generate o information.

755
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:32,784
[SPEAKER_09]: But yun nga, it depends kasi if the data is clean, kaya niya.

756
00:45:32,804 --> 00:45:38,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Pag medyo maraming mga manual adjustment yun, medyo na ano siya.

757
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:45,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So the earlier na makuha namin, the earlier din natin malalaman.

758
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:49,393
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully mag-work siya para konti na lang ihingi namin sa annual schedule.

759
00:45:56,798 --> 00:46:05,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So i think mag-tax update mo na.

760
00:46:05,158 --> 00:46:13,980
[SPEAKER_01]: General ano lang naman, we've been extra busy, the tax team is extra busy nowadays because of several issues.

00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:23,744
[SPEAKER_01]: including new loss this year.

762
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:30,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It started with the Issa Paying Taxes Act early this year.

763
00:46:30,552 --> 00:46:32,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, it really eases the tax compliance requirements.

764
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:33,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it followed by a Real Property Validation Act.

765
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:34,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Then last month, the VAT on digital services.

766
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:36,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just yesterday, we had the Create More.

767
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's four major losses this year in between

768
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:52,463
[SPEAKER_01]: there were several issuances from the Bureau of Eternal Revenue.

769
00:46:52,483 --> 00:46:54,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So allow me to present some of the highlights or salient provisions of these issuances and all.

770
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:58,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So allow me to start with the ISO Paying Taxes Act.

771
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:07,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a slide summarizing the relevant dates.

772
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:11,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So early this year, this one took effect January 22, then the implementing rules and regulations

773
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,706
[SPEAKER_01]: were issued last April.

774
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:18,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the effectivity, it's April 27, 2024.

775
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:29,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless otherwise stated, the new invoicing requirements specifically, it applies to April 27 transactions onwards.

776
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:40,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the subsequent slide, we noted that one of the most significant updates or amendments introduced by AOPT, which pertains to the streamlining of reporting.

777
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:51,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you're a seller of goods, services, or lesser of properties, the timing of reporting will be at the time of sale as evidenced by a BET invoice.

778
00:47:51,985 --> 00:47:54,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And the basis will be gross sales.

779
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:57,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I understand, if you report BET, it's based on collection.

780
00:47:58,013 --> 00:48:00,656
[SPEAKER_01]: But with EOPT, it should now be based on your sales.

781
00:48:00,676 --> 00:48:08,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are allowable deductions such as sales discounts, sales allowances, subject to certain conditions.

782
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:21,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So in view of the change in the timing of reporting for BAT purposes in the subsequent slide, we presented a mechanism introduced by AOBT.

783
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:35,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, if ever that you have accounts receivable and such receivable was not collected within the due date or within the payment term or credit term, you have an option to actually reduce your output BAT on the transaction.

784
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:37,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is merely an option.

785
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:43,417
[SPEAKER_01]: on your part as a seller or even on the part of your suppliers.

786
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:55,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, you have a receivable, say, this quarter, it's already Q4, and the credit term is, say, it will fall in Q1 next year.

787
00:48:55,490 --> 00:49:06,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the following quarter, Q2, in this particular illustration, you will be allowed to claim that as a reduction in your VAT reporting.

788
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:22,168
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, but again this is merely an option especially since there are requirements to be complied with and it includes a closely close monitoring of the status of your receivables.

789
00:49:22,188 --> 00:49:29,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you believe that there is high likelihood that you will be able to collect the receivables then there's no need for you to avail of this mechanism.

790
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:34,843
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also possible from the side of your suppliers that they will avail of this option

791
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:39,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that will be the case, they have to issue a document to you.

792
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:48,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And that document will include a stamp statement saying that they actually claim output BAT credit on the transaction.

793
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:52,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your side, you have to adjust your input BAT.

794
00:49:52,950 --> 00:50:00,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So it applies to you as a seller, but if in case that there's really a high likelihood that you will be able to collect, then there's no need

795
00:50:00,693 --> 00:50:24,321
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to adjust but on the part of your supplier they also have that option in the subsequent slide this one this is just a summary of the updated invoicing requirements prior to april 27 if the transaction happened prior to april 27 but official receipt that's the documentation but april 27 onwards it should be

796
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:43,575
[SPEAKER_01]: date invoice or what we call transitory invoice so i'm sure you've seen some documents say official receipt or bill of statement you strike through the words uh official receipt or bill of statement then you stamp the word invoice or similar wordings that will be the support for

797
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,014
[SPEAKER_01]: sa transaction, sa input ng VAT sa transaction.

798
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:50,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It also applies to you as a seller of service.

799
00:50:50,958 --> 00:51:00,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your case, before you're issuing official receipt, you are now required to issue VAT invoice.

800
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:00,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you already have?

801
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:00,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

802
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:09,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially if you're dealing with large taxpayers, this is closely being monitored.

803
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,942
[SPEAKER_01]: In the subsequent slide, we presented this one

804
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:18,049
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an update on the required information for you to be able to claim the input access.

805
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:37,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So for as long as the file, the middle, the amount of sales, the 12% VAT, the registered name and team of the seller and the purchaser, the date of the transaction, and the description of the transaction are properly presented in the VAT invoice, you may already claim the input VAT on the transaction.

806
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:40,933
[SPEAKER_01]: You will note that business style is no longer necessary.

807
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:51,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And for import tax purposes, even the address of your customer or of the companies no longer necessary.

808
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:57,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the disfied information.

809
00:51:57,685 --> 00:51:58,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to the next one.

810
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,089
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, just a reminder.

811
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:04,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially it appears that in terms of timing it with the earlier.

812
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:12,029
[SPEAKER_01]: between the accrual or recording as an expense or asset in the books and the issuance of the sales document by the seller.

813
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:16,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So parang essentially there is no change in terms of the timing of withholding.

814
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:25,952
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing here is if in case that you fail to withhold or there is an under withholding, it's no longer necessary for income tax purposes.

815
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:29,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, as a withholding agent, that's a separate obligation.

816
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:37,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you fail to withhold on certain transactions, you will still be liable to deficiency withholding tax and penalties.

817
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:42,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And this new rule applies starting January 1, 2024 onwards.

818
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:55,251
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, in your 2023 tax audit, it's still possible that the VIR will raise an issue on this possible disallowance as a result of non-withholding or under withholding.

819
00:52:56,564 --> 00:53:11,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But for, let's say, for 2023, parang may possible disallowance.

820
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:14,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Di ba, allowed din na as long as they assess you on the withholding tax?

821
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:14,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yup.

822
00:53:14,146 --> 00:53:14,827
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the remedy.

823
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:16,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, real pa rin.

824
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:25,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so for 2023 and prior years, provided that you pay the deficiency withholding tax plus the penalties, you can claim the deduction.

825
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:25,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one,

826
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:35,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Like say now is 2024 no?

827
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:39,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Say December 2024.

828
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:41,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Wala pa sa aming yung invoices ng 4 December ng mga suppliers namin.

829
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So when do we withhold?

830
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:45,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And when do we claim the input back?

831
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:54,195
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the withholding, if you actually accrue, most likely ACV will require you to accrue and these are

832
00:53:54,395 --> 00:54:22,900
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less accruable even for tax purposes so you are strictly speaking applying the rules you are already required to be told that's one number two in terms of the info tax since it's for December transaction strictly speaking you should already be reported in your Q4 PET return for this period probably as a practical approach my advice is

833
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:45,495
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for recurring transactions if it's possible to get in advance the supporting invoice from your suppliers that would be helpful but if it's not provided that there's a description that it actually pertains to December transaction that will be another way to

834
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:51,421
[SPEAKER_01]: to be used as a basis for the reporting or BAT process.

835
00:54:51,441 --> 00:55:04,800
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also possible that if the invoice will be dated January, there will be that question on whether you will be able to claim that as input BAT or not in your queue for reporting.

836
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's important is one, if it's possible to get that early.

837
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:12,951
[SPEAKER_01]: In some clients, they request the support that is

838
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:16,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week of December if it's possible.

839
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:18,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for recurring transactions.

840
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:26,258
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's not, January but there's really a clear description that it pertains to December transaction.

841
00:55:26,278 --> 00:55:36,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the latter, there's that risk that it may be questioned by the VR.

842
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Anong due date ang withholding, expanded?

843
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:38,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Say December?

844
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:38,969
[SPEAKER_05]: January 31.

845
00:55:38,989 --> 00:55:39,049
[SPEAKER_05]: 31.

846
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:39,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So medyo pwede pa.

847
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:42,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Mas madali yun.

848
00:55:42,812 --> 00:55:42,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Ano ano?

849
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:47,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung input bot mukhang yun yung medyo kasi new low eh.

850
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:57,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we have to see then how they will assess the client or the taxpayer sa result of this new low.

851
00:55:57,136 --> 00:56:02,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a matter of practical approach, yun yung pwede natin ma-consider.

852
00:56:02,243 --> 00:56:02,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Sige.

853
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:06,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one, just a reminder, business style is no longer necessary.

854
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Retention period, it was reduced to 5 years.

855
00:56:10,508 --> 00:56:14,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using manual or loose slip, dapat hard copies.

856
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:19,317
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using computerized accounting system, you may retain electronic copies.

857
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:21,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this applies 2024 onwards.

858
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,746
[SPEAKER_01]: For 2023 and prior years, unfortunately, it's still 10 years.

859
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:38,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we have this 5-year period, it's also advisable even for those using computerized accounting system to retain the hard copies for at least the next 3 years.

860
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:47,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've seen during tax audit that they still request for the hardcops.

861
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:54,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully eventually the BIR will have an update on their approach given this particular rule.

862
00:56:54,814 --> 00:57:02,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you know wala pa kasi nag-laffi na shortness pasaka?

863
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:04,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano kasi yung in terms of kanbawa may refund,

864
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:12,690
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of failure to file, fraud cases, ang BIR can audit for 10 years.

865
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:17,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually ang 10 years from the date of discovery.

866
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:27,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are saying na actually it's in favor of the taxpayer din lalo na kung may mga ganoong cases na possible na ma-allege sa taxpayer.

867
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:54,192
[SPEAKER_01]: so from 10 years at least at least we're in the right direction if i may say five years tala ngayon baka eventually it may be lower next will be uh this one this one i mentioned earlier the the new loss but this one is a bir issue one so rmc5-2020 438-2024

868
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:57,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It covers the ACES case.

869
00:57:57,799 --> 00:57:59,581
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Supreme Court decision.

870
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:03,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the slide, we presented the highlights of the case.

871
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:23,993
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, in terms of the interpretation of the VIR, especially during VIR audit, their default or general position now is for as long as the services are actually consumed by a Philippine taxpayer,

872
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:34,527
[SPEAKER_01]: the general assumption is it should already be subject to final withholding tax and withholding ban.

873
00:58:34,547 --> 00:58:48,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the subsequent slide, we highlighted as well the clarifications made by the VIR, particularly in light of RMC number 382024.

874
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:52,663
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's a long case

875
00:58:52,981 --> 00:59:01,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, they use this cases case as a basis for their approach in terms of BIR audits.

876
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:10,045
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why in terms of our transactions with non-residents, it's important that we really take a detailed review or

877
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:38,985
[SPEAKER_01]: a detailed approach in terms of reviewing the documents that will include the agreement as well as the supporting documents issued by the suppliers then after we evaluate the actual substance or nature of the transaction we'll see whether we can apply of course under the tax code if the services are entirely rendered outside the Philippines the rule is simple before

878
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:45,823
[SPEAKER_01]: it should not be subject to final withholding tax and even for 12% withholding validity.

879
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:59,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, with this RMC, that's already the position taken by the VIR and on the part of the taxpayer, it's important for us to be ready on how we'll be able to argue otherwise.

880
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:05,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's why now they are looking at the agreements if there are

881
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:09,679
[SPEAKER_01]: an excess to the agreement that will be included.

882
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:24,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be surprised if in the 2023 tax audit, they will request for the agreements, the an excess, sample supporting documents especially if these are material transaction and or recurring transactions.

883
01:00:24,642 --> 01:00:34,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will note in the slide, it includes tourism and hospitality services, the international service provision that is actually covered

884
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:38,783
[SPEAKER_01]: in the RMC that was released by the BIR.

885
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:51,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just for your information, we have several clients now especially those dealing with non-residents especially those with material transactions.

886
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:56,695
[SPEAKER_01]: We are engaged in terms of the review of the agreements and

887
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:24,184
[SPEAKER_01]: ang mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga

888
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:32,756
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the request for confirmation, it will only cover income tax or the final withholding tax.

889
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:43,570
[SPEAKER_01]: For VAT, especially with the subsequent slide, the VAT on digital services, as mentioned earlier, this was passed into law last month.

890
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took effect last month.

891
01:01:45,913 --> 01:01:52,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And the regulator are already working on implementing rules and regulations.

892
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,243
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, it says that

893
01:01:53,729 --> 01:02:01,716
[SPEAKER_01]: For digital services consumed in the Philippines, this will already be subject to 12% withholding payment.

894
01:02:01,736 --> 01:02:09,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the slide, we presented the items included in the law itself.

895
01:02:09,804 --> 01:02:22,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So those digital services that are processed through online search engine, through online marketplace or electronic marketplace, cloud service, online media and advertising,

896
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:51,276
[SPEAKER_01]: online platform or digital goods so digital goods has not been defined in the law but it's it will be defined in the IRR and our expectation is it will almost cover all transactions with non-resident except those that are clearly exempt from BAT such as those services rendered by banks and or non-bank financial intermediaries those

897
01:02:51,593 --> 01:03:07,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Involving online courses, seminars, and trainings, and sale of online subscription-based services provided that these are duly accredited by the CHED, DeafAid, and similar organizations.

898
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:07,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So hindi ka-samar, Jennie?

899
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Netflix?

900
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:10,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Netflix, Spotify, yan.

901
01:03:11,523 --> 01:03:14,968
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, that will be covered by this new law.

902
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:25,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually that's the last item in terms of the tax updates.

903
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:27,627
[SPEAKER_01]: So marami, busy sila ngayon.

904
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Our lawmakers.

905
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:33,076
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, hindi ko pa nashare yung what we call BEPS.

906
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:34,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But ano naman yan?

907
01:03:34,118 --> 01:03:41,710
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something na at least for now significant to multinational corporations.

908
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,453
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's another one that

909
01:03:43,906 --> 01:04:07,729
[SPEAKER_05]: that is being studied by our regulators, particularly the Department of Finance and the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

910
01:04:07,749 --> 01:04:10,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So going back to our 2023 na audit nila, yun nga, doon is dapat nagbighold kami ng mga income tax and VAT for these forex players.

911
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:17,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they disallow, do we still have that remedy to pay for the income tax and all?

912
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:21,254
[SPEAKER_01]: For income tax, we still have that remedy.

913
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So okay pa tayo sa income tax kahit pa walang EOPT.

914
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:29,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So bayaran lang natin deficiency with holding tax plus the penalties.

915
01:04:29,547 --> 01:04:32,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay tayo for income tax.

916
01:04:32,532 --> 01:04:32,812
[SPEAKER_01]: For 2023.

917
01:04:32,832 --> 01:04:34,875
[SPEAKER_01]: For 2024, hindi na siya magmamatter.

918
01:04:34,895 --> 01:04:36,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So kahit pa hindi na we doldan,

919
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:39,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Di naman na siya requirement for income tax.

920
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:43,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang major concern will be yung withholding tax talaga.

921
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:46,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung final withholding tax and yung withholding pad.

922
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:58,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So yung final withholding tax kasi for services, that's 25% na generally denated act siya sa transaction, sa pinabayad natin sa non-resident.

923
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:00,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless meron tayong agreement na

924
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be shouldered by the non-resident foreign corporation, generally.

925
01:05:13,512 --> 01:05:14,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So gross up.

926
01:05:14,673 --> 01:05:17,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So baka 100 talaga yung babayaran sa kanila.

927
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,139
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 babayaran sa kanila.

928
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:20,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Tayo yung magsosolder ng 25.

929
01:05:21,842 --> 01:05:25,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos the 25 will be remitted to the BIR.

930
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:29,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the 25 will be magpuporm part naman ng expense natin.

931
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:36,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Pero ano siya, yung natin benefit natin is 25% lang of the 25.

932
01:05:36,428 --> 01:05:38,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Kasi it will form part of our deduction.

933
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:43,316
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, ang laki na nga nung CWDs natin palaki nang palaki.

934
01:05:43,336 --> 01:05:45,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos I understand may null ko tayo.

935
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:51,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So ano lang talaga siya, ang impact niya is cash flow talaga sa atin.

936
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:56,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike kasi yung ibang kumpanyat, okay lang sila sa ganun kasi malaki naman talaga yung tax payable nila.

937
01:05:57,016 --> 01:06:04,425
[SPEAKER_01]: at least to some extent, mayroon sinang benefit yung 25% nung additional ng tax na sinuswinter nila.

938
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:16,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So if in case naman will take the position na hindi dapat to subject, it will require talaga detailed look over the agreements, the sample supporting documents.

939
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:19,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And if necessary, baka we need to explore

940
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:26,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the tax treaty provision kung meron tax treaty.

941
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:26,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly U.S.

942
01:06:26,712 --> 01:06:27,012
[SPEAKER_05]: yung ano namin.

943
01:06:27,032 --> 01:06:27,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Ayun po.

944
01:06:27,534 --> 01:06:30,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Meron po tayong RPUS tax treaty.

945
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:35,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So titiknan po natin yung conditions ng tax treaty kung makokomply po natin siya.

946
01:06:35,845 --> 01:06:43,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, magsasubmit tayo ng request for confirmation with all the necessary documents.

947
01:06:43,277 --> 01:07:01,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, a pan-review ni BIR kung masabi niya na talagang they are compliant with the conditions as per tax treaty, they will issue what we call certificate of entitlement, proving na yung transaction is exempt from the final bid only.

948
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:16,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So kung yun yung parang... Ano na tawag dito?

949
01:07:16,553 --> 01:07:18,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung sa TAPS treaty?

950
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:19,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry.

951
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:30,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Kung may remedy... Pwede pa ba yan i-remedy by telling them na, ito yung deficiency ninyo sa foreign suppliers and then can you make a contract that exists?

952
01:07:30,987 --> 01:07:32,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if na-assess kami ngayon, pero yung future,

953
01:07:32,545 --> 01:07:39,995
[SPEAKER_07]: At least para hindi na magkaroon ng deficiency ulit, pwede na nang yamend yung contract to be compliant?

954
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:45,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Pwede naman siya pero generally ang application is prospective.

955
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:57,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another one is, dati kasi no, pag may nakalagi ka na na the services will be entirely rendered in say US, dati they stopped there.

956
01:07:57,857 --> 01:07:59,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Ngayon kasi they really did

957
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:03,186
[SPEAKER_01]: on the nature of the transaction.

958
01:08:03,206 --> 01:08:10,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the transaction will require say, visit here in the Philippines talaga, nabawalan ang ganun yung transaction, no?

959
01:08:10,873 --> 01:08:27,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So kahit pa may ganong statement, we've seen in actual tax audits na kini-question nila, especially kung merong provision na from time to time, say from time to time there will be visits in the Philippines, kung may mga ganong provisions or any other

960
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:32,317
[SPEAKER_01]: similar provision na might be in conflict with that provision.

961
01:08:32,337 --> 01:08:41,808
[SPEAKER_01]: So yun yung siguro pabantayan lang natin para lang at least mas ma-manage natin yung possible question during tax audit.

962
01:08:41,828 --> 01:08:46,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing is yung yun nga yung with the application of the RMC.

963
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:55,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Medyo nagiging ano kasi no general yung approach yung yung interpretation ni BIR na parang basta nandito sa Pilipinas yung

964
01:08:55,891 --> 01:09:24,987
[SPEAKER_01]: yung consumer in our case tayo then they will already impose final withholding, tax and withholding but so ano lang no, just a heads up so ang mga yari na lang doon is yun niya ang mga yari will submit the contract hopefully the billings or the invoices from them na nakalagay talaga na say the services are rendered in US or any other country outside the Philippines so that will help naman nakita namin but there are also cases na dependent talaga dun sa

965
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:34,825
[SPEAKER_01]: nature ng transaksyon kahit pa may ganun, kinachallenge pa rin nila especially yung talagang tingin nila where there are other documents

966
01:09:35,193 --> 01:09:38,778
[SPEAKER_01]: that will prove na mayroon nagpinita dito eh.

967
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:55,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So kung ganun talaga yung nangyari naman, ang normal na nagiging advice namin sa cliente namin is to file a request for confirmation para at least hindi na tax code yung pangahawakan mong basis for the non-withholding but rather the tax treaty na.

968
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Sa tax treaty kasi, generally,

969
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,684
[SPEAKER_01]: 6 months or 183 days.

970
01:10:00,704 --> 01:10:11,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung hindi ka mag-exceed naman dito, then pwede nilang sabihin na walang permanent establishment and therefore walang final withholding tax na dapat iimpose.

971
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:23,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So yung mga parang ongoing contacts sa amin na hindi walang end date, that's considered kasi nga

972
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:29,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Halos yung mga contracts namin, ano 1995 ganyan.

973
01:10:29,087 --> 01:10:29,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Mahababa eh.

974
01:10:30,029 --> 01:10:34,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So yun kasi defender rin sa probation ng tax treaty.

975
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:42,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Meron kasi ang tax treaty na ang pagbibilang nila ng 183 days or 6 months per fiscal year or per calendar year.

976
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:49,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So mayroon din namang tax treaty na talagang continues.

977
01:10:49,216 --> 01:11:13,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So kahit pa 1995 yan, kung mayroon ka ng ma-determine nila, for some reason kung anong procedure nila, masasabi nila na in the entire duration of the contract mayroon na-breached na yung 6 months or the 183-day period generally, then they will say that there is actually a permanent establishment and therefore even with the tax treaty,

978
01:11:13,338 --> 01:11:18,624
[SPEAKER_01]: You are subject to... That particular transaction is subject to final withholding tax.

979
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:23,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So, magdindepende sa wording din ng tax treaty.

980
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Sa ano yan?

981
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:28,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you secure itong confirmation sa special unit na naman ng PIR?

982
01:11:28,335 --> 01:11:34,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Sa International Tax Appears Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

983
01:11:34,402 --> 01:11:34,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Sa ITAL.

984
01:11:34,602 --> 01:11:34,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Sa ITAL.

985
01:11:34,783 --> 01:11:43,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So ano siya, it's... Kung ang mga iyari is... Hindi mo siya we withhold dan, for instance, ang gagawin natin is request for confirmation.

986
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:49,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be request for confirmation, tapos may mga dokumento siya na kailangan.

987
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:53,566
[SPEAKER_01]: It includes the agreement and some other supporting documents.

988
01:11:53,586 --> 01:11:58,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang ibang cases naman, ang nangyari is bibitultan natin.

989
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:01,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So ibig sabihin conservative yung ating position.

990
01:12:01,895 --> 01:12:07,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So si non-resident naman, sasabihin niya, hindi entitled kami to the treaty benefits.

991
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:10,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So ang mga yari naman, hindi na request for confirmation.

992
01:12:10,949 --> 01:12:14,713
[SPEAKER_01]: ang tawag na is that tax treaty relief application.

993
01:12:14,733 --> 01:12:20,058
[SPEAKER_01]: So, sasabihin naman doon is, oh, tama nga, hindi nga siya subject.

994
01:12:20,078 --> 01:12:31,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So, mangyari, kung confirm siya ni BIR, then ang next stage will be magpafile ng refund for the amount na naweigh held doon sa transaction.

995
01:12:31,249 --> 01:12:33,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So, depende siya kung ano yung matiting approach natin.

996
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:40,298
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, reminder ko lang, this covers income tax or on your side, it's the final withholding tax.

997
01:12:40,615 --> 01:13:02,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not extend to value added tax or the withholding meaning.

998
01:13:02,762 --> 01:13:05,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, assuming na paglabas nitong IRR ito, then may mga conditions ba doon na, if not more than 3M ang parang income, diba, ng COVID Corporation.

999
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Ano yun?

1000
01:13:05,845 --> 01:13:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to ask from them a certification na hindi sila mag-exit ng 3M.

1001
01:13:07,312 --> 01:13:18,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung ano kasi, well at least based on the law itself, yung 3 million kasi, it's critical for the registration of the non-resident.

1002
01:13:18,503 --> 01:13:27,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they will breach the 3 million, they are required to register for VAT purposes and therefore they are required to file their own bat return.

1003
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Pero sa side natin, as customer, Philippine-based customer, whether or not registered sila,

1004
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:45,256
[SPEAKER_01]: For as long as it's covered by the law, digital services consumed in the Philippines natin, then we are required to withhold 12% withholding.

1005
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:47,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, ano lang naman siya?

1006
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,662
[SPEAKER_01]: In and out.

1007
01:13:48,682 --> 01:13:52,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang withholding path kasi is, generally it's on top.

1008
01:13:52,147 --> 01:13:53,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say 100 plus 12.

1009
01:13:54,443 --> 01:14:10,925
[SPEAKER_01]: so wala talaga tayong ibabawas sa kanila then GAT 12 will form part of our input tax naman sa regular piling natin ng BAT return then again ano bang BAT payable position ba tayo ngayon or excess input tax credits position?

1010
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:24,383
[SPEAKER_01]: kung BAT payable naman it's a good thing kasi bayaran mo lang magagamit mo naman pabawas mo siya so at least sa BAT payable position more on may konting araw lang na para cost of money kumbaga kasi ang

1011
01:14:24,616 --> 01:14:33,888
[SPEAKER_01]: deadline for ringgitans of the withholding back is on the 10th, following the end of the month.

1012
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:44,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can report that as input back on our regular filing of the back return.

1013
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:50,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So looks like as of now based on the input that we have, yung final withholding tax talaga yung we need to take a look at it.

1014
01:14:50,808 --> 01:14:52,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Balikak ko lang siya sinabi mo kanilig na yung sa withholding, you can apply for refund.

1015
01:14:53,438 --> 01:15:02,266
[SPEAKER_07]: yung pag-iil nila for it.

1016
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:02,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean you initially pay?

1017
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:03,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So hindi pa rin makukuha?

1018
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:05,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Practical, practical.

1019
01:15:06,029 --> 01:15:07,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano naman kasi siya?

1020
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:14,676
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typical kung ang iyong non-resident na supplier, hindi mo apili.

1021
01:15:14,696 --> 01:15:22,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So kung hindi mo siya apili, and talaga nakikita namin ito eh, conservative talaga yung Philippine based customer, they will withhold.

1022
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:33,951
[SPEAKER_01]: kasasabiya nila yung kanilang supplier o supplier kung gusto mong ano yan, isubject yan sa treaty provision, tax treaty really publication tayo.

1023
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:35,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos kapag na-confirm, refund mo yan.

1024
01:15:35,995 --> 01:15:46,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Pero meron din naman, I should say, in terms of their discussion as part of business consideration, sige supplier, di kita wiwi doldan, ha?

1025
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:49,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Pero kailangan ko mag-secrete ng request for confirmation.

1026
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:54,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Kailangan lahat ng dokumento na kailangan ipasa for that application.

1027
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Ibigay mo sa akin.

1028
01:15:55,851 --> 01:16:04,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Para at least, pag sinabig ko yan kay BIR, pag aaralan nila yan, kapag pinaprobaan ni BIR yan, walang tayong problema.

1029
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:08,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Kasi ako magkakaproblema kapag di ako nag-vidun tapos wala akong ganyan.

1030
01:16:08,165 --> 01:16:10,528
[SPEAKER_01]: At least sa BIR level kasi.

1031
01:16:10,548 --> 01:16:16,635
[SPEAKER_01]: E, syempre tayo naman, since si BIR mag-audit sa atin, and kaya kung kaya naman natin mag-comply,

1032
01:16:16,835 --> 01:16:24,248
[SPEAKER_07]: It's advisable talaga.

1033
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:24,368
Okay.

1034
01:16:24,388 --> 01:16:24,829
[SPEAKER_07]: May isa pang question.

1035
01:16:24,849 --> 01:16:27,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Client kasi namin ng ADB, what is it considered as?

1036
01:16:27,534 --> 01:16:27,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Adb?

1037
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:30,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, ADB ah, Asian Development Office.

1038
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I think may local offices.

1039
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:33,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Meron, hindi nga yun nga yung local.

1040
01:16:33,905 --> 01:16:38,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So, kasi nga marami sinang foreign rent personnel, di ba?

1041
01:16:38,755 --> 01:16:47,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Pero kasi kung si ADB naman na binabayar natin as a local entity.

1042
01:16:47,284 --> 01:16:50,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, dalawa sila kasi yung iba literature yung iba consultant.

1043
01:16:50,308 --> 01:16:55,073
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just want to understand kung ano ang, ano kasi nga ang consultant, what do we mean?

1044
01:16:55,093 --> 01:17:00,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Consultants ng ADB na foreigners, what do we mean?

1045
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:02,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Separate siya sa ADB?

1046
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:02,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Oo.

1047
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:07,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi ang dina- Sorry.

1048
01:17:07,326 --> 01:17:08,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Minsa kasi sila yung binibigyan na sa kanila yung

1049
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:18,118
[SPEAKER_01]: money nila yung ganoon so siguro first things first sino ba ang kakontrata natin pag ganoon ang case?

1050
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:34,440
[SPEAKER_07]: yung minsan pinara yung passenger hindi yung in terms of the transaction with the consultant siya na kasi nga binigay yung money sa kanya siya anong transaction natin?

1051
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,982
[SPEAKER_01]: minsan kasi income payment ba yung

1052
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Hindi, iyan papasok.

1053
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:53,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then... Ano to, yung... We also pay a GSA na nasa labas ng bansa.

1054
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:53,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Parang ganun.

1055
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:56,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to understand yung magiging relationship niya.

1056
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:00,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Na... Kasi foreigner siya.

1057
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:05,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Nagbayad sa amin.

1058
01:18:05,445 --> 01:18:11,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, nagbayad sa inyo?

1059
01:18:11,572 --> 01:18:13,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Nagbayad sa amin.

1060
01:18:13,674 --> 01:18:14,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Aso customer siya?

1061
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:16,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Customer siya.

1062
01:18:16,477 --> 01:18:17,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Tapos nung nagbayad kami to a... a... ano man?

1063
01:18:17,418 --> 01:18:17,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Kuya na rin, agency nila.

1064
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:18,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Abroad.

1065
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:18,580
Abroad for the services.

1066
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So, is there anything we need to withhold?

1067
01:18:20,282 --> 01:18:25,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least for this purpose kung customer natin siya, okay lang tayo ito.

1068
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:25,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Ngunang issue.

1069
01:18:25,748 --> 01:18:29,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Offensive customer that we are ordering something from outside.

1070
01:18:29,843 --> 01:18:30,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Ayan.

1071
01:18:30,725 --> 01:18:37,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yan, that... Well, I can't say categorically right now, but it will depend on the agreement.

1072
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:45,113
[SPEAKER_01]: But RMC, the RMC earlier, by specifically, there's that risk.

1073
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:49,101
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that risk that it will be subject to the final bidonding tax and even bidonding BID.

1074
01:18:49,655 --> 01:18:58,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So for widowning BAT, it may be further strengthened by the Baton Digital Services once the IRR is released.

1075
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:00,088
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the possibility.

1076
01:19:00,108 --> 01:19:06,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also possible that in the IRR, it will be clear that it's not subject or it's not covered.

1077
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:17,991
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the RMC, specifically 5-2024, there's that risk especially given our experience in the Baris BIR audience right now.

1078
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:32,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So wala nang makakatravel na, no?

1079
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:43,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Locals and foreigners, if we add up itong anong, pang-holding, na-payments sa operators, sa frauds, kasi we have to consider, yung parang i-add namin.

1080
01:19:43,588 --> 01:19:51,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, nakita ko nga parang, I think si Netflix or Spotify atan, karoon na nang increase agad na notice sa, di ko alam isa sa kanila,

1081
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:59,404
[SPEAKER_01]: may notice na nag-increase na sila, siguro anticipating the impact of the ban on digital services.

1082
01:19:59,485 --> 01:20:13,425
[SPEAKER_01]: So yun, nakikita namin from what we saw, meron mga conservative talaga, nagwiwinod na, meron din naman talagang using the tax code provisions since these are services rendered outside the Philippines.

1083
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:31,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They will really argue na hindi siya subject, but of course in terms of tax audit, it's important that we'll be able to provide the necessary documentation, agreement, invoices, billings, and any other documents to prove our position.

1084
01:20:31,033 --> 01:20:35,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Third will be the application of the tax duty insofar as FWT or income tax is concerned.

1085
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:38,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So may mga nag-explore ng kanong avenue.

1086
01:20:39,258 --> 01:20:55,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So yun lang, just sharing the options.

1087
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So would you know like if there are...

1088
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:19,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Clients that are already asking, even without HIRR, if they are already asking their foreign suppliers, what will be their position?

1089
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:24,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Even without the ban on digital services, there are already clients taking the conservative position to withhold in light of the RMCs.

1090
01:21:24,938 --> 01:21:27,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there are.

1091
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:37,009
[SPEAKER_01]: But meron na ring, meron pa ring clients na, eto kasi ang tax code probation naman.

1092
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:40,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung wala naman talagang services and they are confident that they will be able to prove that, then no withholding yung ginagawa nila.

1093
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:53,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung iba, yun, exploring another option, in addition to the tax code probation, they will make use of the tax treaty probation.

1094
01:21:53,143 --> 01:21:54,844
[SPEAKER_01]: But that will entail a filing of the request for confirmation as I mentioned earlier.

1095
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:35,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Pag-a-blog na lang tayo franchise ng Marina Sanya.

1096
01:22:35,757 --> 01:22:35,897
[SPEAKER_07]: O Adox.

1097
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi kasi airlines alone, they're subject to percentage tax.

1098
01:22:37,138 --> 01:22:37,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Dapat.

1099
01:22:37,278 --> 01:22:38,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Pero ngayon, dahil tayo yung

1100
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:48,248
[SPEAKER_07]: gumibili na ng airline on behalf of the clients.

1101
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:50,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi there's a different collecting company, Ayata.

1102
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:56,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Ayata doesn't provide, has no provision for vat nor with hoodie.

1103
01:22:56,656 --> 01:23:00,980
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the position that the airlines are giving?

1104
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Wala siya eh.

1105
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:04,504
[SPEAKER_00]: We're discussing siya kay Ayata.

1106
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:11,133
[SPEAKER_07]: O kasi nga malabuh yan eh.

1107
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:13,758
[SPEAKER_07]: They all have their offices here, but they're subject to percentage tax.

1108
01:23:13,778 --> 01:23:22,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh kami yung bumibili sa kanila, alam naman naman kami may withholding may VAT on something that doesn't have VAT.

1109
01:23:22,175 --> 01:23:25,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So paan yan, e iba-iba rin yung ano nila yung

1110
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:33,515
[SPEAKER_07]: bilateral agreements nila, it's not the same.

1111
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:35,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Pala sa different taxation than the other airlines.

1112
01:23:35,517 --> 01:23:37,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So, paano rin yun?

1113
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:37,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung ganoon?

1114
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:41,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Ano naman, ma-iintindi ko lalat yun.

1115
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:43,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Paano naman?

1116
01:23:43,405 --> 01:23:43,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Talaga ba?

1117
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:43,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Baka mahihan.

1118
01:23:43,905 --> 01:23:54,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung iba kasi, meron talaga, like with the Yopitino ECB, the realistic industry, meron talaga silang naging dialogue with the VIR.

1119
01:23:54,451 --> 01:24:01,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand baka karoon ng RMC to be released specifically for their industry.

1120
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:08,249
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen one for the power industry, tapos may palabas for construction.

1121
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:20,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So baka this is something kung talaga namang ano siya, it's because of the industry, something na... Baka pwedeng i-ano, no?

1122
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:21,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Si Elyata and yung ano...

1123
01:24:22,092 --> 01:24:22,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yun.

1124
01:24:22,773 --> 01:24:29,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Kaya na inaano nila na I fix the position paper.

1125
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:32,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, not all agencies are corporations.

1126
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:37,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Mas marami yung hindi corporations in the first place.

1127
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:49,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to put it together na it's just the Ayata agents, which is just about 200, considering that there are 10,000 agents.

1128
01:24:49,807 --> 01:24:50,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a minority but that's the volume.

1129
01:24:51,826 --> 01:24:55,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung 200 na yun.

1130
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:55,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the ones with the volume.

1131
01:24:55,812 --> 01:24:57,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So medyo, nahihihirapan ako.

1132
01:24:57,074 --> 01:25:11,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And ay atas, partially been healthy with certain things.

1133
01:25:11,656 --> 01:25:16,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But not on yun nga yung sa widodi.

1134
01:25:16,584 --> 01:25:18,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi yung percentage tax siya.

1135
01:25:18,587 --> 01:25:19,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So parang ang hirap isip din.

1136
01:25:19,188 --> 01:25:19,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang same with sa power.

1137
01:25:19,729 --> 01:25:20,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Meron din silang parang iyakta yung ay...

1138
01:25:21,172 --> 01:25:32,666
[SPEAKER_09]: IOM ba yun?

1139
01:25:32,686 --> 01:25:38,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Basta meron ni sinang gano, may clearing ano sila.

1140
01:25:38,373 --> 01:25:38,654
[SPEAKER_09]: IOM, I forgot.

1141
01:25:38,674 --> 01:25:39,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka yun nga yung... Tignan natin.

1142
01:25:39,655 --> 01:25:40,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Baka dapat ano, diba?

1143
01:25:40,096 --> 01:25:41,377
[SPEAKER_09]: May alignment na dito.

1144
01:25:41,397 --> 01:25:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: You may want to also ano.

1145
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:43,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Syempre dapat ayayosin niyo muna yung position niyo before.

1146
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:48,490
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to VIR, diba?

1147
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:52,135
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, hindi advisable muna kay VIR.

1148
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:55,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Siguro as at least the top players, you gather.

1149
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganun ginawa ng iba't industries.

1150
01:25:57,423 --> 01:25:59,166
[SPEAKER_01]: They gather.

1151
01:25:59,186 --> 01:26:00,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang real to.

1152
01:26:00,308 --> 01:26:02,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano nang nangyari talaga?

1153
01:26:02,431 --> 01:26:05,396
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do before disissuance?

1154
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:06,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano bang ginagawa namin?

1155
01:26:06,217 --> 01:26:11,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos they discuss, okay, aligned na mong pala tayo.

1156
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:12,947
[SPEAKER_01]: But with disissuance, ano bang concern natin?

1157
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:23,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos they will take that, with this one we understand the rationale but here's the thing, ito yung siguro difficulty in the implementation, etc.

1158
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:27,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Then may mga position paper as an organization.

1159
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,085
[SPEAKER_01]: They request for confirmation.

1160
01:26:31,105 --> 01:26:35,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Meron din na kami nakita na parang deferral.

1161
01:26:35,134 --> 01:26:36,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung pwede, at least man lang.

1162
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:44,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung di talaga pwedeng entirely, hindi applicable sa inyo, pwede bang deferral man lang?

1163
01:26:44,473 --> 01:26:49,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us time to implement yung mga ganas.

1164
01:26:53,748 --> 01:27:01,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have that service na to check our contract?

1165
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:06,410
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually do it with our tax advisory team.

1166
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Kasi kami sa tax compliance team.

1167
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:10,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So we combine it.

1168
01:27:10,316 --> 01:27:12,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang several clients na kasi namin siya nagawa.

1169
01:27:12,952 --> 01:27:22,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So nagiging two phases siya.

1170
01:27:22,085 --> 01:27:24,348
[SPEAKER_01]: First phase is the tunalagang review of the contract, the agreement, what are the options available.

1171
01:27:24,368 --> 01:27:26,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second phase will be the implementation phase.

1172
01:27:26,952 --> 01:27:35,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Dun nga papasok yung magpapayal ng request for confirmation, to strengthen our position, and kung ano pa yung mga pwedeng gawin.

1173
01:27:35,805 --> 01:27:36,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we engage, sino susulata naman?

1174
01:27:40,002 --> 01:27:48,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can discuss internally na.

1175
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:55,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually earlier ganito rin yung pinag-ugusapan namin sa another client.

1176
01:27:56,199 --> 01:27:57,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganun din, marami rin sila.

1177
01:27:58,842 --> 01:28:02,245
[SPEAKER_01]: In their case naman puro happy leads kasi naman yung kanila.

1178
01:28:02,265 --> 01:28:08,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Mas lalong sa kanila crucial kasi whether may impact sa kanila sa Philippine entity or wala,

1179
01:28:09,297 --> 01:28:12,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Mababawasan mo yung babayaran mo dun sa appellate mo ha, Brod.

1180
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:15,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So globally, tatamaan sila.

1181
01:28:15,126 --> 01:28:33,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So kaya kailangan talaga may strengthen yung position.

1182
01:28:33,553 --> 01:28:34,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Mag-sandwich mo.

1183
01:28:34,595 --> 01:28:34,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Mag-sandwich mo na.

1184
01:28:34,995 --> 01:28:36,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Pasensiyan na.

1185
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:38,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so good news at least on that one.

1186
01:28:45,933 --> 01:28:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Ano parang position niyo?

1187
01:28:55,452 --> 01:28:57,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Parang hindi na is a doing business?

1188
01:28:57,196 --> 01:28:59,520
[SPEAKER_05]: For the pastayers?

1189
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano ng mix naman?

1190
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:05,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Kasi naman siyang portion na hindi na highlight.

1191
01:29:05,778 --> 01:29:18,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sa mga battery fund claims kasi medyo nagstreamline talaga ng process and the required documents.

1192
01:29:18,257 --> 01:29:20,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos another thing yun ya, yung natanggal yung requirement to withhold para maging deductible.

1193
01:29:20,781 --> 01:29:27,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung pinawasan yung required information para maklaim mo yung input funds.

1194
01:29:27,712 --> 01:29:28,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So medyo meron pa rin ang positive.

1195
01:29:28,934 --> 01:29:32,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, mas na-highlight yung mga medyo not so good.

1196
01:29:33,706 --> 01:29:50,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Globally, nakita ko rin ang Netflix, ita-tax na rin sa Europe.

1197
01:29:50,471 --> 01:29:54,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Basta na talaga ang stream pa na rin all, kasi makaka-akas yung Netflix.

1198
01:29:54,037 --> 01:29:55,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Ang inisip lang nila yung, siyempre lahat nang nakikita nila, mga stream.

1199
01:29:55,519 --> 01:29:56,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Pero hindi na.

1200
01:29:56,437 --> 01:30:02,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Maraming transactions na yung team, ganun ka straight forward.

1201
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:05,072
[SPEAKER_07]: O kasi ngayon, like the hotels, they're all in the GDS.

1202
01:30:05,092 --> 01:30:06,375
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a contract with them.

1203
01:30:06,395 --> 01:30:08,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have a contract with their aggregator.

1204
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:13,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So, paano mo naman siya ita-tax eh hindi naman kami nagbubok doon?

1205
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:24,882
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just looking through the aggregator.

1206
01:30:24,902 --> 01:30:26,544
[SPEAKER_07]: So, parang umlabo, yung ganun.

1207
01:30:26,564 --> 01:30:26,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Pag sila nito ba?

1208
01:30:26,924 --> 01:30:27,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, aggoda yan?

1209
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:28,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung aggregator ba yun?

1210
01:30:28,426 --> 01:30:30,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Isa yan sa mga aggregators, but that's more of a B2C platform kasi.

1211
01:30:30,769 --> 01:30:43,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Meron kasi yung tinatawag na general distribution system, that that computer collates all the different contracts with everyone in the world, which is used everywhere in the world.

1212
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:53,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So dahil nga with that kind of a set up, yun ang ginagamit namin na system, yung ganun.

1213
01:30:53,622 --> 01:31:08,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So doon namin kinukoya umatala, yun lang naman lahat ng hotel na kuni namin doon.

1214
01:31:08,436 --> 01:31:09,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Meron kaming, alam nyo, it's impossible.

1215
01:31:09,396 --> 01:31:10,057
[SPEAKER_09]: It's impossible.

1216
01:31:10,077 --> 01:31:10,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Parang hindi na pag-isipan.

1217
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:10,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Parang ganun.

1218
01:31:10,918 --> 01:31:12,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi nga ngayon, the how we do business ang iba na eh, diba?

1219
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:13,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Oo.

1220
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:31,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But yun nga, yung regulations, medyo... Well, mayroon na siyang digital pero... yun yung reservation system kasi natin.

1221
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just we're touching a reservation system.

1222
01:31:33,533 --> 01:31:34,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1223
01:31:34,776 --> 01:31:35,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Wala naman.

1224
01:31:35,297 --> 01:31:35,757
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't deal directly.

1225
01:31:35,777 --> 01:31:37,801
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't deal directly with all the hotels in the world.

1226
01:31:37,821 --> 01:31:37,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1227
01:31:38,001 --> 01:31:39,023
[SPEAKER_07]: They only have the inventory of it.

1228
01:31:39,222 --> 01:32:00,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Dahil nga nakita namin, yung gubot namin yun.

1229
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:01,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not anymore like a one on one.

1230
01:32:01,575 --> 01:32:01,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Malabo eh.

1231
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:05,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Parang naroon.

1232
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:06,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Yun yung hindi nila nag-get na portion siguro.

1233
01:32:06,742 --> 01:32:07,183
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see how it goes.

1234
01:32:07,203 --> 01:32:08,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi at least kung power, mayroon siyang

1235
01:32:08,973 --> 01:32:10,216
[SPEAKER_07]: cleaning house.

1236
01:32:10,236 --> 01:32:12,562
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just for power.

1237
01:32:12,803 --> 01:32:17,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Like an airline at saka dapat ang taxable portion ngayon.

1238
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:20,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the first leg of the journey eh.

1239
01:32:20,343 --> 01:32:24,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi may bayabaya points eh yung ganon.

1240
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:57,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Ok na.

1241
01:32:57,881 --> 01:32:58,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Ok na.

1242
01:32:58,061 --> 01:32:58,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Ok na.

1243
01:32:58,201 --> 01:32:59,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Nagutom ako dito sa... Wait niya ng common na reply sa akin.

1244
01:32:59,543 --> 01:33:02,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Parang nagagutom naman natinis kasi.

1245
01:33:02,788 --> 01:33:04,471
[SPEAKER_07]: So ito, may kasalanan.

1246
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shoot the messenger now.

1247
01:33:07,335 --> 01:33:07,836
Shoot it on the next one.

1248
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:35,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Hindi, kapyan na lang yung lawmakers.

1249
01:33:35,297 --> 01:33:41,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Para maingin din yung nakikina na ng kresyo habang tumata siya exchange rate.

1250
01:33:48,029 --> 01:34:10,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Pero pang nakikin si mga suppliers natin ay namin kasi namin operators.

1251
01:34:10,475 --> 01:34:10,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Kasi mas maganda na e, no?

1252
01:34:11,016 --> 01:34:12,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Sa ating nga, yung mga kanon yung... Kasi mga operators natin, e. Mabawa, nilalala.

1253
01:34:12,698 --> 01:34:13,599
[SPEAKER_08]: E, hindi i-attack, kasi sila muna kasi naman.

1254
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:13,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Naka siya, Japan.

1255
01:34:13,979 --> 01:34:14,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yung operator ang gano'y nalaman ang contact, yun.

1256
01:34:15,001 --> 01:34:16,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Ngunod naman tali siya, tapos tayo sa kanilang brand.

1257
01:34:16,082 --> 01:34:16,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Pwede naman pretend, no?

1258
01:34:16,582 --> 01:34:16,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Pwede.

1259
01:34:16,723 --> 01:34:16,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Pero on top.

1260
01:34:16,983 --> 01:34:17,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Pwede sabihin niya, no?

1261
01:34:17,464 --> 01:34:17,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike, no?

1262
01:34:17,664 --> 01:34:17,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I-in piece.

1263
01:34:19,568 --> 01:34:38,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Parang mag-rather din na, ande yata.

1264
01:34:38,487 --> 01:34:40,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Pala, entindihan, and then, if you want us to help, then at least ande na sila.

1265
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:40,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Tama namin yung ano, yung isang tax lawyer.

1266
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:58,952
[SPEAKER_07]: O dami ito tako ne.

1267
01:34:58,972 --> 01:35:05,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Pati yung credit card ne, yung wala pa phone present.

1268
01:35:05,604 --> 01:35:05,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano niya?

1269
01:35:05,804 --> 01:35:05,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano yun?

1270
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Ano yung cash ko talaga?

1271
01:35:06,485 --> 01:35:06,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang narinig ko dyan.

1272
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:08,388
[SPEAKER_01]: May discussion even before the pandemic about it.

1273
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:10,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang seeking clarification on the tax base.

1274
01:35:10,893 --> 01:35:11,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Di pala natuloy.

1275
01:35:11,233 --> 01:35:12,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm waiting for update dyan.

1276
01:35:12,055 --> 01:35:13,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang may initial discussion with the BIR daw.

1277
01:35:13,703 --> 01:35:21,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi nga yung cash flow ay understand, yun yung tok-tok.

1278
01:35:21,495 --> 01:35:39,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Nung ano pa yan, nung time ni Russellis pa yan, na we were doing the tax position paper at that time na hindi yung natuloy yun.

1279
01:35:39,302 --> 01:35:41,325
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was the only official document that was out there.

1280
01:35:41,345 --> 01:35:42,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Pero alam ko, there were initial talks with

1281
01:35:43,353 --> 01:35:57,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Sino na nga yung ex-SGB na nandon noon noon ng panaman ni Kimenares?

1282
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Panaman pa yun ni Kimenares every time?

1283
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:00,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Yung mga sa EDB na?

1284
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Si ano nga na yung... Yung Joel.

1285
01:36:01,301 --> 01:36:01,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Ay!

1286
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:01,962
[SPEAKER_07]: At ano?

1287
01:36:01,982 --> 01:36:02,082
Joel.

1288
01:36:02,102 --> 01:36:03,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Ayaw ko sabihan.

1289
01:36:03,564 --> 01:36:03,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Bakit?

1290
01:36:03,705 --> 01:36:04,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yung Joel Tantor.

1291
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:09,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Hindi.

1292
01:36:10,937 --> 01:36:26,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Baka eh.

1293
01:36:26,457 --> 01:36:26,617
Siya ba?

1294
01:36:26,637 --> 01:36:26,797
Oo yata.

1295
01:36:26,817 --> 01:36:26,938
Oo na.

1296
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:27,278
Di ba nag-D.I.R.

1297
01:36:27,298 --> 01:36:27,378
yun?

1298
01:36:27,398 --> 01:36:28,960
Then napuntang last na, well, I don't know kung madumpa sa E.D., di pa walang.

1299
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:29,661
Hindi ko na alam saan siya na yun.

1300
01:36:29,681 --> 01:36:29,741
Oo.

1301
01:36:29,761 --> 01:36:29,821
Oo.

1302
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:30,302
Aning yung part ng U.P.

1303
01:36:30,322 --> 01:36:30,402
U.P.

1304
01:36:30,422 --> 01:36:30,582
Exactly.

1305
01:36:30,602 --> 01:36:30,682
U.P.

1306
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:30,843
system.

1307
01:36:30,863 --> 01:36:31,163
Parang yata eh.

1308
01:36:33,067 --> 01:37:00,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So bako muna ka siya, no?

1309
01:37:00,177 --> 01:37:00,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Ako ba ako si Chancellor?

1310
01:37:00,698 --> 01:37:01,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Parang... Parang hindi siya nang... Parang hindi siya, no?

1311
01:37:01,879 --> 01:37:02,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi kung na nga yung two girls na kasama niya,

1312
01:37:03,323 --> 01:37:28,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Bajesa, talag.

1313
01:37:28,286 --> 01:37:28,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Nakaasal na.

1314
01:37:28,546 --> 01:37:28,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Baka na sa photo.

[SPEAKER_01]: Steph na ba?

1320
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:31,249
[SPEAKER_01]: O yun, si Steph.

[SPEAKER_01]: si Carol is a business taxor business.

01:37:38,398 --> 01:37:47,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked to her recently kasi nga yang ANA na airline and also United Airlines.

1325
01:37:47,852 --> 01:37:50,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the only two that are withholding on commission.

1326
01:37:50,616 --> 01:37:59,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Pero kasi all the rest are reporting on net from the airline.

1327
01:37:59,749 --> 01:37:59,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So yun.

1328
01:37:59,909 --> 01:38:01,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just trying to talk to them kasi it never existed na

1329
01:38:01,525 --> 01:38:10,479
[SPEAKER_07]: We acknowledge that we have commission dahil nga we have transaction fee with the client.

1330
01:38:10,499 --> 01:38:11,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So paano kami magkakaroon ng commission?

1331
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:13,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Yung ganon.

1332
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:22,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Isang magulo rin yun kasi sino ba yung, kanino ba kami kumuha ng income so to speak?

1333
01:38:22,377 --> 01:38:22,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It's with the client eh.

1334
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:54,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm halfway with Ayatta kasi they have a column now in their reporting that says supplier discount of Indiana supplier commission so pero kasi it's not open to the Philippines yung column na yun so I'm trying to find out how to open that column that particular column so that the airlines will also report on net mas mababa rin yung

1335
01:38:54,496 --> 01:38:57,981
[SPEAKER_07]: babayaran nilang tax, diba?

1336
01:38:58,101 --> 01:39:01,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi nga, it's not anymore on the gross.

1337
01:39:01,405 --> 01:39:08,435
[SPEAKER_07]: The gross is meant to be there just as a filing with ano naman, DOTR, nung mga fares nila.

1338
01:39:08,455 --> 01:39:16,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Kasi they also have to put the fares in the GPS na ginagamit namin dahil nga globally nila binibigay.

1339
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:21,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So the others are on commission, others are on net base.

1340
01:39:21,031 --> 01:39:22,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So, doon,

1341
01:39:22,964 --> 01:39:37,403
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the term commission is used very loosely in the industry.

1342
01:39:37,423 --> 01:39:43,151
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a commission tool, so to speak.

1343
01:39:43,171 --> 01:39:44,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Sabi ko nga, pag dinin man ang GAR, basa sa kanila, it's commission.

1344
01:39:44,553 --> 01:39:44,773
Commission.

1345
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:45,434
And it's a term in our industry.

1346
01:39:45,454 --> 01:39:45,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Parang ganun.

1347
01:39:45,734 --> 01:39:46,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different... ano...

1348
01:40:02,823 --> 01:40:19,228
[SPEAKER_07]: tapos lahat yun global template so they cannot just change here to suit our Philippine needs na napakalingit ng market yung parang ganun as compared to Europe, US yung ganun iba eh

1349
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:56,971
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what are the next steps after this.

1350
01:40:56,991 --> 01:40:57,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Crucial yung kayo mismo.

1351
01:40:57,491 --> 01:41:01,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that alignment in terms of what you do now and what will you do as a result.

1352
01:41:14,677 --> 01:41:35,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Mabilis pa lang ang pagkain mo.

1353
01:41:35,983 --> 01:41:36,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Ma-address or na?

1354
01:41:36,864 --> 01:41:37,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Yun yung within 6 months naman.

1355
01:41:37,505 --> 01:41:38,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Nakita namin recently, within 6 months nakakasagot naman.

1356
01:41:38,666 --> 01:41:38,947
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll see.

1357
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:39,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Depende rin kasi sa peculiarity ng income payment.

1358
01:41:39,988 --> 01:41:40,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung pretty straightforward naman, mas mabilis pa.

1359
01:41:41,009 --> 01:41:41,730
[SPEAKER_01]: At least within that 6 month period.

1360
01:41:44,663 --> 01:41:59,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Tapability pa ang DICT ay stock yung mga services.

1361
01:41:59,170 --> 01:41:59,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yung lang, no?

1362
01:41:59,470 --> 01:41:59,871
[SPEAKER_05]: E yun lang mga dito.

1363
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:06,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Mga products, mga diwala bago ay wala silang budget, e yan pa.

1364
01:42:13,267 --> 01:42:35,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Dato na, Mike.

1365
01:42:35,997 --> 01:42:36,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Ang nag-increase ng rate yung YouTube premium.

1366
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:37,339
Ah, YouTube premium.

1367
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:37,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunod-sunod na yan.

1368
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're not here.

1369
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:38,901
[SPEAKER_07]: What's yung individual consumers?

1370
01:42:38,921 --> 01:42:39,282
Tayo na naman, no?

1371
01:42:39,302 --> 01:42:40,303
Tadaga, papasarin din ng... Sa atin din ang paray.

1372
01:42:50,003 --> 01:43:06,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Sino nagatin doon sa angchang na, ano?

1373
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:12,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Sino nagatin sa angchang na... Speaker?

1374
01:43:12,323 --> 01:43:12,584
...tag-a-SGB?

1375
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:12,904
De Jos po, asa.

1376
01:43:12,924 --> 01:43:13,345
Ah, si Victor De Jos.

1377
01:43:13,831 --> 01:43:25,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Siya kasi nag-eat samin sa discussions ng Bandot Digital Services.

1378
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:26,963
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, mayroon siyang column sa business world about the impact of Bandot Digital Services.

1379
01:43:46,197 --> 01:44:09,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinong technical working group pa yan ng BIR sa IR?

1380
01:44:09,592 --> 01:44:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Nakalimutan ko yung name, but we have a contact with them.

1381
01:44:10,774 --> 01:44:12,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Ang alam ko, they will soon have a public consultation about the contents of the drama IR.

1382
01:44:12,597 --> 01:44:13,278
[SPEAKER_05]: When you mean public consultation?

1383
01:44:13,298 --> 01:44:13,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Open to all.

1384
01:44:13,771 --> 01:44:41,685
[SPEAKER_01]: usually sa amin from our side kasi we may have clients na affected so they also extend that even to the private corporations I think like the EOPT sa Facebook nila they stream that live but they also have yung parang value for face to face identities mas okay kung yung sa face to face kasi mas maikita mo sila

1385
01:44:41,986 --> 01:45:08,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you can directly raise your concerns or questions.

1386
01:45:08,404 --> 01:45:09,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, if not possible, at least naka-stream naman live sa Facebook page nila.

1387
01:45:09,966 --> 01:45:10,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Alight.

1388
01:45:10,127 --> 01:45:10,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

1389
01:45:10,327 --> 01:45:11,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Abang may anang susunod na kabaleta.

1390
01:45:20,427 --> 01:45:42,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So ano yan, it will also be a part of your audit na yan na kung one compliant ang clients nyo sa audit?

1391
01:45:42,356 --> 01:45:43,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think not siguro namin, but I'm not... Strictly, no.

1392
01:45:43,577 --> 01:45:44,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Kasi hindi rin namin, magtanongin.

1393
01:45:45,065 --> 01:46:00,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Pag-a-gusyong magpatax kong clients, right?

1394
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:07,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Kasi ang bubulat-latit talaga nila yung... Well, in preparation din sa class, we'd most likely be doing that.

1395
01:46:07,276 --> 01:46:09,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we have two ongoing projects kasi plano nga nila mag-computerize sa accounting system.

1396
01:46:09,533 --> 01:46:30,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So, ang nangyayari is yung inputs ng engagement namin, they will use it as part of the implementation of the CES.

1397
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:34,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Para at least, like yung mga ano ba yung kulang sa substantiation, ano ba yung normally nakikita sa tax audit ni BAR na pwedeng ma-address ng mga certain changes sa process.

1398
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:54,848
[SPEAKER_05]: na ginagawa especially for tax reporting, tax filing.

1399
01:46:54,868 --> 01:46:55,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So ganoon yung nagiging approach ng cliente.

1400
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:56,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Which comes first?

1401
01:46:56,151 --> 01:46:57,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Parang yung guidance nyo, bago ni-present ng cliente sa inyo, naano nilang process or...

1402
01:46:58,606 --> 01:47:13,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang nangyayari isa sa ganitong engagement, we anumuna, we'll have that what we call kick-off meeting with them to further discuss yung approach namin, the timeline.

1403
01:47:13,996 --> 01:47:14,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Parang ganito, planning for audience.

1404
01:47:15,329 --> 01:47:40,206
[SPEAKER_01]: then there will be a portion na what we call they will share with us yung mga nakikita nilang possible focus areas like kung ano bang transactions natingin nila may concern sila or most likely baka merong kailangan tignan because for some possible tax concerns but kami we have that ano naman standard procedures din

1405
01:47:40,743 --> 01:48:03,596
[SPEAKER_01]: na we have the general procedures, tapos meron din kaming procedures na specific to the industries of our clients.

1406
01:48:03,616 --> 01:48:05,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Kung service industry, kung let's say meron kaming manufacturing, pharma, ganyan.

1407
01:48:05,419 --> 01:48:06,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Para kaming nagkakandap ng BIR audit.

1408
01:48:06,562 --> 01:48:09,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Na walang penalty.

1409
01:48:09,866 --> 01:48:17,214
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be the few na maunakan natin siya.

1410
01:48:17,234 --> 01:48:31,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Ang 5 days lang, walang penalty.

1411
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Tapos yung iba, dahil di kasi may mga general tax amnesty.

1412
01:48:32,412 --> 01:48:34,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So kung yung results ng aming engagement, to the extent na quantifiable yung exposure,

1413
01:48:34,945 --> 01:48:42,076
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be able to use that to at least have a number in mind.

1414
01:48:42,096 --> 01:48:47,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Nabawa ang computation ng amnesty is 2% of North Korean assets.

1415
01:48:47,364 --> 01:48:48,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganyan.

1416
01:48:48,265 --> 01:48:52,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Pag kinumpute ko yun, you will be able to avail of the amnesty for say 2023 in prior years.

1417
01:48:52,752 --> 01:48:56,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So ang lalapas na amount si 20 million, nabawa lang.

1418
01:48:56,512 --> 01:49:03,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, yung exposure na nakita sa tax engagement namin will be about 100 million.

1419
01:49:03,525 --> 01:49:12,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and mukhang talagang malabo na ma-depend mo yung position mo in light of the issues na ni-raise namin.

1420
01:49:12,102 --> 01:49:15,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung ginagawa ng client, i-avail na ni Retax Amnesty.

1421
01:49:15,609 --> 01:49:16,410
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it covers 2023 and prior years.

1422
01:49:16,778 --> 01:49:31,781
[SPEAKER_01]: As compared doon sa kumbaga parang self-assessment na rin ang cliente na P100M kung sa kaling lumabas yung talaga sa tax audit plus lalaki pa kasi yun because of the penalties.

1423
01:49:31,801 --> 01:49:36,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung interest kasi lalaki.

1424
01:49:36,888 --> 01:49:42,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So, something na pwedeng... although right now kasi wala pa kami naririnig ng tax office din.

1425
01:49:42,337 --> 01:49:42,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Puro collection.

1426
01:49:42,677 --> 01:49:43,258
[SPEAKER_01]: New laws tax audit sabi niyo.

1427
01:49:43,762 --> 01:50:01,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Short live lang kasi yung ano eh, tapos gumawa rin ako.

1428
01:50:01,193 --> 01:50:01,673
[SPEAKER_01]: At asyado rin malaki eh.

1429
01:50:01,693 --> 01:50:02,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung 2017 prior, yung glass amnesy.

1430
01:50:02,415 --> 01:50:03,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Ay hindi ba kayo nag-avail during the time?

1431
01:50:03,537 --> 01:50:07,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Yun kasi po, self-assessment naman natin hindi naman aabot sa ganung ang mga talaga advisable na we avail of that.

1432
01:50:07,263 --> 01:50:07,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Bano yung basis nila eh.

1433
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:29,125
[SPEAKER_05]: hindi ka nung ipang yung previous amnestis na talaga ayun medyo, medyo mapapang minimum lang o palo, 75, 100,000 pesos naging ano po kasi based on percentage talaga yung

1434
01:50:29,813 --> 01:50:51,990
[SPEAKER_01]: last na general tax havenist except for i think for small talaga ng entities na medyo papasok doon sa mababa talaga but if you're a medium to large tax payers doon ka sa percentage na malaki-laki pag kinonvert talaga kaya parang nga naman ko kakawin ang ano eh nagkabing

1435
01:51:02,551 --> 01:51:23,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1436
01:51:23,284 --> 01:51:23,805
Thank you then for coming.

1437
01:51:23,825 --> 01:51:24,306
